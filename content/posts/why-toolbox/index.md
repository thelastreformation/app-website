It is often difficult to give a precise definition of what The Last Reformation (TLR) exactly is. But one of the things that is often said is that TLR provides a number of *discipleship tools*. An example of such a tool is the 'kickstart weekend' or the 'TLR Map'.

The purpose of this app is to make these tools even more useful in the kingdom of God and to add a number of new tools.

Hence the name: toolbox.

I'm not sure if this is going to be the final name or if it's just the code name for this project. What do you think?
