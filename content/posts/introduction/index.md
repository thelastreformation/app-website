Hello everyone! For a while, I've been entertaining the idea of creating an app for The Last Reformation (TLR). However, it didn't become concrete until I received a message from a friend (Asia) who also does a lot of practical work for this movement. She mentioned that she was in the process of developing an app. When it turned out that she was also harboring similar ideas, I thought: this is from God.

From that moment, we decided to get serious about it!

## A little background

The Last Reformation is a remarkable work of God that has spread to the farthest corners of the world by now. To get an idea of how this work has spread, you can take a look at the [TLR Map](https://tlrmap.com).


God is doing mighty work through the many disciples who are simply applying the biblical teachings of [Torben Sondergaard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdzZv-XMXPU&list=PL0gVAb8r3Mj-GbT18XWdro0Kt_6wM0kv_) in their daily lives.

Despite countless attacks from the realm of Satan, this movement continues to grow! And I am excited to see how God will also use this app to reach even more people with the Gospel of our Lord Jesus.


# What can the app do?

At this moment, nothing yet, because at the time of this writing, the app is still in the very early stages of development. But below is a short list of different ideas that we are currently brainstorming about.

## ➡️ A Learning Path for Disciples

People who have just come to faith need nourishment. Healthy teaching from the Word of God. Depending on where people are in their walk with God, the app offers a learning journey. This can be followed both individually and in a group setting.

One of the ideas is that the app offers these journeys in the form of *challenges*. Each challenge offers a piece of discipleship. An example of such a challenge is: start a Bible discovery group. Or: pray for healing when you see someone with a physical ailment. A completed challenge earns a *badge* on your profile.

## ➡️ A companion during outreach

What people associated with TLR have in common is that they actively approach people on the streets or wherever they may be to share about Jesus. There are several great ideas for this, but I will leave those for a later article.

## ➡️ Connect with disciples around

The app can keep track of your location and that of disciples around you. If given permission, the user can see disciples in their area, visit their profiles and make contact.

## ➡️ Integration with the TLR Map

We aim to re-use the accounts of the TLR Map. In other words: you can login on the app using your already existing account of the TLR Map. We also plan to add more integrations between the TLR Map and the app.
